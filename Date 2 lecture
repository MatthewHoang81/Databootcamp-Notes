Idempotent data
Relying on the latest partition of a not properly modeled scd table Slowly changing dimension data exception should be backfilling old data.
types of scd's
type 0 does not change arent actaully scd (birthdays)
type 1 you only care about the latest value  NEVER USE THIS TYPE BECAUSE IT MAKES YOUR PIPELINES NOT IDEMPOTENT ANYMORE 
type 2 you care about what the value was from start date to end date 
current values usually have either an endate that is null far into the future like 9999-12-31 hard to use since there is more than 1 row per dimension, you need to be careful about filtering on time only type of scd that is idempotent
type 3 you only care about the original and current benefits you only have 1 row per dimension drawbacks you lose history in between original and current partially idempotent
