Did a user log in today?
  the log event would be a fact that informs the "dim_is_active" dimension
  VS the state "dim_is_activated" which is something that is state-driven, not activity driven
You can aggregate facts and turn them into dimensions
  is this person a "high engager"? a "low engager"?
    CASE WHEN to bucketize aggregated facts can be very useful to reduce cardinality
Why should shuffle be minimized?
big data leverages parallelism as much as it can
some steps are inherently less "parallelizable" than others
What types of queries are highly parallelizable
Extremely parallel
  SELECT,FROM,WHERE
kinda parallel
  GROUP BY, JOIN, HAVING
Painfully not parallel
  ORDER BY
Shuffle is all the data on a specific key needs to be on a specific machine
order by at the end of a query, 1 row of data on a billion machines, The only way to ensure the data is ordered is to put it on one machine and order it.
you can use order by in window functions only if you have partion by as well.
How the data is structured depends on what key words you need to use.
How do you make group by more efficient
Give group by some buckets and gaurantees
REDUCE THE DATA VOLUME AS MUCH AS YOU CAN
How to reduce fact data modeling gives you superpowers
Impact of analysis
  Multi year analyses took hours instead of weeks
  unlocked "decades long slow burn" analyses at Facebook
Allowed for fast correlation analysis between user level metrics and dimensions
The final stras for why zach quit working at Facebook
I built this framework for 50 core metrics and 15 core dimensions that enabled 10+ year analyses to happen in hours instead of weeks
They told me this wasnt senior engineer caliber
